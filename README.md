# Overview of the project:
The purpose of this project is to build a map that tracks not only the earthquakes for the past 7 days, but the magnitude as well. The map also includes pop-up information for each incident.

# purpose :

1. Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
2. Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
3. Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
4. Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
5. Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
6. Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
7. Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
8. Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
9. Render maps on a local server.

# Resorses :
1. Data Source: Earthquake Data
2. Data Source: Fault Line Data
3. Software: Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS & D3.js.

# Summary :
Access GeoJSON data website here
The map displays all earthquake data over the past 7 days and it also shows where all tectonic plates are located around the world.
By clicking on one of the circles, that represents and earthquake, you can view the magnitude and the location of where the earthquake occurred.
You can choose to toggle the map view from 3 different styles: Street View, Satellite View, and Dark View.
Below image will show the all 3 styles and ***Add Tectonic Plate Data***,***Add Major Earthquake Data***,***Add Major Earthquake Data***.
